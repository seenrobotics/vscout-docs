Contributing
============

Welcome to the team! Everyone is welcome to contribute code via pull
requests, to file issues on GitHub, reproduce, or fix bugs that people
have filed, to add to our documentation, or to help out in any other

our trust and demonstrated a commitment to the project.

Developing for seenrobotics
---------------------------

To develop for seenrobotics, you will eventually need to become familiar
with our processes and conventions. This section lists the documents
that describe these methodologies. The following list is ordered: you
are strongly recommended to go through these documents in the order
presented.

1. Our :doc:`./code-of-conduct`, which stipulates
   explicitly that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and
   professional. This also documents our conflict resolution policy and
   encourages people to ask questions.
2. :doc:`./values`, which talks about what we care most
   about.
3. :doc:`./tree-hygiene`, which covers how to land a PR,
   how to do code review, how to handle breaking changes, how to handle
   regressions, and how to handle post-commit test failures.
4. Our :doc:`./style-guide`, which includes advice for how
   to write your code.
